# Roadmap

This document outlines the planned features and ongoing work for the Babelbot project.

## Planned Features

*   [ ] Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier configuration.
*   [ ] Implement a more advanced logic system to handle smart movement.

## Work in Progress

*   **Skill Selection Rework:** The current skill selection function needs to be reworked to make it more robust and less prone to errors in detection. This will involve improving the image recognition logic and adding better error handling.
